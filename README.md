# 3D-FaceAlignment-in-the-wild

The repository contains my project 3D FaceAlignemnt in the wild where we have implemented and trained the pre-trained model of paper [How far are we from solving the 2D \& 3D Face Alignment problem? (and a dataset of 230,000 3D facial landmarks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.07332.pdf)" on 3D menpo benchmark dataset.

## Requirements

- Menpo Dataset (https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/1st-3d-face-tracking-wild-competition/)
- PyTorch
- OpenCV 
- Dlib Face detector

Please note that the Dlib face detector performs poorly on challeneging dataset which exhibit large variations in pose. To increase the accuracy of the face detection we recommned try different methods like mtcnn, SSD etc.

### Pre-Trained Model
